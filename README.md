## FAQ

**Q: What macOS versions are supported?**
A: Jollycat requires macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later. It runs natively on both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs.

**Q: Is Jollycat a subscription?**
A: No. Jollycat is a one-time purchase of $14.99 with up to 5 Mac activations.

**Q: Does Jollycat upload my files anywhere?**
A: No. All file processing happens entirely on your Mac. The only network requests are for license validation and optional update checks. There is an optional file sharing feature (via GoFile.io) that only activates when you explicitly choose it.

**Q: How do I activate my license on a new Mac?**
A: Enter your license key in Jollycat's settings. If you've reached your activation limit, deactivate a device first from the settings panel.

**Q: A conversion failed. What should I do?**
A: Open a [Conversion Issue](https://github.com/davidullo/jollycat-support/issues/new?template=conversion_issue.yml) with details about the source format, target format, and any error message shown.
